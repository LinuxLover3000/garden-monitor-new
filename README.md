# garden-monitor

Dates: June 2022 - Aug 2022

This project is designed to use a humidity sensor and a webcam attached to a Raspberry Pi to monitor a plant. Running tests locally on machine proved successful, however there was insufficient time to test on real hardware before leaving for college.
This project gave me greater insight into working on a project with a team. My friend Paul independently worked on data.py and data.db on a separate branch while I worked on the website portion.
This project gave me a basic look into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Jinja2 was used for creating HTML templates and integrating with Python code. My python code can be found in website.py. HTML can be found in templates. CSS is in static/css.
